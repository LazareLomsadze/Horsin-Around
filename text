We are building an ecosystem where victory only depends on the holder. Race will be held on the 8th Saturday after collection’s sold out. Holders have this period of time to prepare themselves and their horses for the race and they need to practice hard because the prize is epic. Race will have only 3 winners and they divide the prize accordingly.

Benefits are as simple as gameplay, only holders or as we call them jockeys will have exclusive access to race, that means only holders will be able to participate in the game and watch it live on the website. By purchasing Horsin’ Around #NFT, you become the part of the jockey establishment, which means you train and fight to chase the prize. As the reward every jockey will get one item from 4 that strengthens horses. However, compared to the grand prize, these benefits are not much. 3 winners divide the grand prize: First place will be rewarded with 70%, second best will get 30% and third one will take 10% of the volume trade’s 50%, the other half will be used for perfectationing the horse racing ecosystem. On the basis of horse racing and appreciation of its history, we decided to let holders make bets on the race with crypto or their own horses, the place for betting will be on our discord channel. Every jockey will get +1 nft from the upcoming collection.
